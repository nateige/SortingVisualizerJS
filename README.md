# SortingVisualizerJS

This project is a simple React Web-Application used to visualize how different sorting algorithms sort through data in an array.


# Homepage:

Upon opening this web-application, the user will see this homepage:

The user can interact with the Select Algorithm dropdown list to choose from the following Sorting Algorithms:
Quick Sort
Selection Sort
Heap Sort
Comb Sort
Bubble Sort
Insertion Sort
Gnome Sort
Shell Sort

Once an algorithm has been selected, the user can click the "Run Animation" button to see the algorithm in action.


# Line Chart:

The Line Chart on the bottom of this web-application acts independently from the animation display above. This line chart is used to compare the runtime of each algorithm on large sets of data.

Upon loading the page, arrays of random numbers will be generated of the following size:
100x100
500x500
1000x1000
2000x2000

The user can select from 4 of the algorithms listed to compare their runtimes.
Once the "Chart Sort" button has been pressed, the user can see the runtimes displayed on the graph like the example below.
